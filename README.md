# 2D-lidar-SLAM
SLAM project for playing around with the SLAMTEC rplidar A2 and mapping the surroundning environment. An idea could be to hook this up to a ROS solution for a race car (example)

This project requires that the rplidar_ros repo is install on the ros application. Specifically, version 1.5.7 is ruquired, otherwise the c++ build essentials on Xenial won't be compatible.
